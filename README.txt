# TicTacToeMiniMax
F# Functional Programming

TicTacToeMiniMax uses a branch of Artificial Intelligence called Game Theory. This program uses the MiniMax Algorithm which involves exploring a search tree that enumerates all possible moves you could make, and for each of those, all possible moves that your opponent could make, and for each of those, all possible moves you could then make and so on. For simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe, it is possible to consider all possible combinations of moves all the way to the end of the game, where either one player has won or it is a draw. These ended games becomes the leaf nodes of the search tree. 
This repository contains:
    - A pure functional implementation using F#
    - An impure F# implementation that uses mutable states to improve performance
